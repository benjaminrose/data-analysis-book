# Fisher Forecasting


## Precision vs Accuracy

Definitions.

Examples of systematic errors (reduced accuracy):
* Using a stretched measuring tape
* A scale that is not properly zeroed
* reading an indicator line from a poor angle

Examples of random errors (reduced precision):
* Measuring timing that depends on reaction time
* Multiple people taking turns making the reading
* Rounding numbers


These types of errors affect our estimations and model fitting in different ways. For a Gaussian, systematic errors shift the mean while random errors inflate the standard deviation.
