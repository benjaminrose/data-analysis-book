## Aims of this book

For most Physicists, Astronomers, and other natural scientists our work revolves around data. Yet, we spend more time learning about physical theories then how to properly glean information from the data we collect. It takes some knowledge and experience to know what statistical tool you should use, similar to how we learn when a physical approximation is no longer valid.
Finally, understanding data is the most transferable skill for any recent Ph.D. graduate. 

The aim of this course is to provide you will the tools needed to start graduate research. We cover a collection of content I taught myself over my graduate education and postdoctoral work. Since it covers a lot of content, there are reference at the end of each section for further reading and more detailed explanations. These are usually the tools I used to teach myself.

Since the goal of this glass is to prepare you for research, the practice problems are closer to an advisor's emails than a typical textbook homework problem. They are less specific, more open ended, and focused on conveying an answer to others.

## How to use this book

## Why not other books

We share this with the social scientists, however, our data and models are very different. In social science, the data has a lot of undesirable noise and typically simple linear models. However, in the physical sciences, we usually have very clean data, high correlations, but complex underlying models. In Astronomy, you add the fact that you only have one observation and you can't control the experimental setup. It is with this in mind
