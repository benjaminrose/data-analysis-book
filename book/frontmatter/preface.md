This class covers a collection of content I taught myself over my graduate education and postdoctoral work. Since it covers a lot of content, there are reference at the end of each section for further, more detailed explanations. These are usually the tools I used to teach myself.

In Astronomy, you add the fact that you only have one observation and you can't control the experimental setup. It is with this in mind
