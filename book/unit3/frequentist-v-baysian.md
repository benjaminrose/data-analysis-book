# Frequentist vs Bayesian

## Reviewing P-values

What is the p value telling you?

P(data | H_0).

## Bayes' theorem

$P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)$

So, if we typically use P(D|F), what does this mean?

$P(F|D) = P(D|F) P(F) / P(D)$

What is the probability of the data? Lets make this proportional,

$P(F|D) \propto P(D|F) P(F)$
