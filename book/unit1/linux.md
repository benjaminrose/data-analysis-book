# Linux

Most of our computing will be done in a UNIX-like environment. This is the terminal on macOS, Linux, or the Linux subsystem for Windows. This is not like GoogleDocs, and may be very unfamiliar to users that are use to modern cloud data and mobile operating systems. 


## Kodiak

Baylor has its own Linux server (a remote computer that can host many users). This is called Kodiak. The administrators of Kodiak already have a good set of introductory tutorials. So I point you to their [tutorials](https://its.web.baylor.edu/research/high-performance-and-research-computing-services/hprcs-system-support/kodiak-beginners) rather than write my own.

When looking at the Kodiak tutorials, specially look at these sections:

- Logging In
- Logging Out
- Directories and Files
- Nifty Stuff
